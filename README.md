## Why?

I run a windows laptop that doesn't have an in-built way to merge/manipulate pdfs. I usually use [ilovepdf](https://www.ilovepdf.com) to manipulate pdfs but although it is "free", it has a few caveats:

- It is **slow**: Merging PDFs takes way too much when you have many PDFs because the files are uploaded to a server rather than merged client-side.
- It is not entirely **"free"**: the free version of ilovepdf has a limit of 100 MB and 25 files for a merging a PDF, which is enough for most use cases but not all. You need a premium subscription to manipulate large/many files. Many tools like 'WORD to PDF' have limits as low as 15 MB.

React PDF Tools aims to combat these limitations  by providing users with a free, fast and easy to use way to manipulate PDF files client-side. It is open-source, has no pesky file size/quantity limitations  and is much much faster.
